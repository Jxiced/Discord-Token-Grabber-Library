# Discord-Token-Grabber-Library
A .NET library developed to create Discord token and other information grabbers with ease.

# Usage
Replace all occurances of "webhook-here" to your own server's webhook URL, this is the webhook which will be displaying the captured tokens.

# Requests
I do not know JS, I got it to work with luck, for those that do, the JS in the text files may look extremely messy. If you're able to optimise/clean-up the code I would greatly appreciate it.
